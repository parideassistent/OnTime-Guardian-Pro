## 🌟 Why This Exists
As someone with ADHD, I built this app to solve:
- "Out of sight, out of mind" struggles
- Time blindness (always running late)
- Medication forgetfulness
- Last-minute panic before appointments

## ✨ Key Features
| Feature | ADHD Benefit |
|---------|--------------|
| 🔊 **Voice reminders** | Auditory cues cut through mental fog |
| 📍 **GPS triggers** | "Buy milk when near grocery store" |
| 🆘 **Emergency button** | Instantly shares location with caregivers |
| 🧠 **Low-spoon mode** | Minimalist interface reduces overwhelm |
// Example: Location-based alert
{
  type: "location",
  message: "Don't forget your wallet!",
  trigger: "When 0.5mi from home"
}
